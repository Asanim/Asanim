# Welcome!

I'm a passionate and skilled professional so on and so forth... 

Key skills are Embedded Linux, C++, AWS IoT, and Full Stack Web Development, but I will pick up anything if a project requires it. 

My journey in the tech world revolves around creating solutions and bringing ideas to life. My skill of choice is common sense, the wheel has been reinvented many times in software development... the key is finding the right wheel to use. 

## Recent Projects
- ADAS and AI pedestrian detection systems purpose built for earthmoving machinery
- AWS IoT and Greengrass enabled devices for MQTT communication, remote updates, multimedia upload
- Fullstack websites: React,Vuejs: Material UI, Vuetify. SEO optimisation, multi-platform, responsive analytics
- Multi-tenant analytics platform for pedstrian detection systems - Image/video snapshot review, at-a-glance fleet wide graphs, heatmaps, fault monitoring with email notifications.
- AI/ML fine tuning for YOLO series of AI models.
- Python based installer scripts - commissioning production ready systems
- Greengrass device management - software update of distributed and performance critical systems.

## Open source projects: 
- [quadruped-project](https://github.com/Asanim/quadruped-project) -  Four legged spider-style walking robot. This project is a derivative of other similar projects online, including the original project by Regis Hsu and the SunFounder Crawling Quadruped Robot Kit for Arduino. 
- [vinmo](https://github.com/Asanim/vinmo) - A differential drive robot with gazebo simulation and environment mimicking a vineyard. This remains a work in progress 
- [greengrass-components](https://github.com/Asanim/greengrass-components) - Demonstrates MQTT Publish/Subscribe, IoT Shadows, and Defer Deployment in C++ implementation with convenience scripts for the deployment of AWS Greengrass applications
- [s3-file-uploader](https://github.com/Asanim/s3-file-uploader) -  Handles multimedia uploads in a purely C++ application running as an AWS Greengrass component. This project demonstrates how to authenticate and use AWS SDK for C++ on a AWS IoT/Greengrass device. 
- [Yolov11x-orin-nano-multi-cam](https://github.com/Asanim/Yolov11x-orin-nano-multi-cam) -  Yolo v11 multi-camera inference application for evaluation of the Nvidia jetson orin nano. It features model conversion/export scripts, usb camera enumeration and orchestration of detection pipelines.
- [rpi-5-halio](https://github.com/Asanim/rpi-5-halio) - Real-time object detection using a Hailo AI Kit on Raspberry Pi 5. It supports multiple USB cameras simultaneously, processing frames with latest-frame capture techniques to minimize latency. The application can handle single inputs (images/video/camera) or automatically detect and process multiple USB cameras in parallel, displaying each camera feed in separate OpenCV windows with object detection annotations.

## Older Projects
- Full stack marketplace web application utilizing MariaDB, vue and vuetify
- Circumference monitoring system for qualtiy control in manufacturing utilizing 2D LIDAR. Range of techniques for de-noising pointclouds are investigated
