# Welcome!

I'm a passionate and skilled professional so on and so forth... 

Key skills are Embedded Linux, C++, AWS IoT, and Full Stack Web Development, but I will pick up anything if a project requires it. 

My journey in the tech world revolves around creating solutions and bringing ideas to life. My skill of choice is common sense, the wheel has been reinvented many times in software development... the key is finding the right wheel to use.
