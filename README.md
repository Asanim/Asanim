# Welcome!

I'm a passionate and skilled professional so on and so forth... 

Key skills are Embedded Linux, C++, AWS IoT, and Full Stack Web Development using Node.js. But I will pick up anything if a project requires it, heavens forbid VTL. My journey in the tech world revolves around creating innovative solutions and bringing ideas to life. I thrive upon open ended problems and freedom of choice. My skill of choice is common sense. In my experience, the wheel has been reinvented many times in software development... often the key is finding the right wheel to use.
