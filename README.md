# Welcome!

I'm a passionate and skilled professional so on and so forth... Now that that is out of the way, my main focus is in Embedded Linux, C++, AWS IoT, and Full Stack Web Development using Node.js. But I will pick up anything if a project requires it ;), but heavens forbid VTL. My journey in the tech world revolves around creating innovative solutions and bringing ideas to life. I thrive upon open ended problems and freedom of choice. My favoured skill of choice is common sense and often it leads me to finding the most effortless path to each given problem. In my experience, the wheel has been reinvented many times in software development... the key here is finding the right wheel to use.
